# How to Restore Your Original FoggyMirror App

## Quick Solution:

Your original **FoggyMirror** project is still intact in `/Users/kat/Documents/Foggy Mirror/`

The **MagicMirror** project we created is in `/Users/kat/Documents/MagicMirror/`

## To Use Your Original Working App:

1. **Close the MagicMirror project in Xcode**
2. **Open your original project**: 
   - Double-click `/Users/kat/Documents/Foggy Mirror/FoggyMirror.xcodeproj`
3. **That's it!** Your original FoggyMirror app with camera and breath detection should work as before.

## What You Have:

### Original FoggyMirror (Working):
- Location: `/Users/kat/Documents/Foggy Mirror/`
- Has: Camera view, breath detection, drawing on fog
- This is the one from your README that was working

### New MagicMirror (Incomplete):
- Location: `/Users/kat/Documents/MagicMirror/`
- Attempted: Animal selection, spa theme, water droplets
- Had issues with UI updates

## Recommendation:

**Use your original FoggyMirror project** - it was working well!

If you want to add features to it in the future, we can do so more carefully, one feature at a time, testing as we go.

Your original app is safe and ready to use! ðŸŽ‰
